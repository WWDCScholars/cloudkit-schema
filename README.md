# WWDCScholars CloudKit Schema

This repo contains the CloudKit schema that powers the WWDCScholars [iOS app](https://github.com/WWDCScholars/iOS-app) and [website](https://github.com/WWDCScholars/web-app). The development and production schemas should only differ when new features are currently in development.

Schemas are automatically exported using [Apple's `cktool`](https://developer.apple.com/icloud/ck-tool/) ([CKToolJS](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/cktooljs)).
